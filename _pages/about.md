_I used to sit in class and listen to the terms come floating down the room like paper airplanes. Geology was called a descriptive science, and with its pitted outwash plains and drowned rivers, its hanging tributaries and starved coastlines, it was nothing if not descriptive. It was a fountain of metaphor..._ - [John McPhee](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/first/m/mcphee-annals.html){:target="_blank"}

# About Me
Hey, I'm Ben. Formerly a PhD student and PostDoc within the Remote Sensing and Earth Surface Processes [research group](https://up-rs-esp.github.io/){:target="_blank"} at the University of Potsdam in Germany. Now freelancing in sub-arctic [Nome, Alaska](https://www.visitnomealaska.com/){:target="_blank"}. 

My background is in geology, including field observations and mapping, and I later shifted to cutting-edge remote sensing and big data analysis. Advances in satellite and drone technology allow me to investigate water and sediment routing through landscapes, and also to bridge gaps between near and far measurements. I am particularly interested in the quantitative analysis of topographic data (DEMs and point clouds) and in measuring sediment transport (grain-size distributions).

I try and keep things open source, you can check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/bpurinton){:target="_blank"} for code snippets and inspiration.

## Research Projects
See my [Research](/research/index.html){:target="_blank"} page for details.
