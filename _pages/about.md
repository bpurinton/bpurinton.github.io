> _I used to sit in class and listen to the terms come floating down the room like paper airplanes. Geology was called a descriptive science, and with its pitted outwash plains and drowned rivers, its hanging tributaries and starved coastlines, it was nothing if not descriptive. It was a fountain of metaphor..._ - [John McPhee](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/first/m/mcphee-annals.html){:target="_blank"}

# Who?

Hey, I'm Ben. Formerly a scientist within the Remote Sensing and Earth Surface Processes [research group](https://up-rs-esp.github.io/){:target="_blank"} at the University of Potsdam in Germany. Now freelancing in sub-arctic [Nome, Alaska](https://www.visitnomealaska.com/){:target="_blank"}. 

# What?

My background is in geology, including field observations and mapping, but I specialized in remote sensing and geomorphology. I use satellites, drones, handheld cameras, geodetic measurements, and a lot of computer coding to investigate water and sediment (boulders, pebbles, and, yes, even *dirt*) routing through landscapes. I'm particularly interested in bridging gaps between close-up and far-away measurements, and in pushing the limits of available technologies with quantitative techniques. 

# Where?

I try and keep things open source, you can check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/bpurinton){:target="_blank"} for code snippets and inspiration. I enjoy science communication and get my fix via [instagram](https://instagram.com/dirt_facts){:target="_blank"}. I should probably tweet, but I don't.

On this site, my [research](/research/) page contains some of the science I've done, with a few links to the [publications](/publications/) that came out of it. You can also find my current [CV](/cv/). 

By the way, I started [blogging](/blog/). Let's see how that goes!
