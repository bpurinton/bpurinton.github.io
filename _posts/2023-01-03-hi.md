This blog is going to be a collection of notes to myself, hopefully some of these are useful to others. I will post about computer programming and mix that in with some Earth science, because, you guessed it, *I <3 Dirt*.

After years of working off a forked copy of the minimal mistakes Jekyll theme for academic pages ([here](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io){:target="_blank"}), I decided it was time to start from scratch. I had little understanding of website development in 2018 when I first setup my site. Now that I'm learning more about Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, and how to deploy a site, I'm ready to build up a new, simplified website.
