I am working on an outline for a textbook for a fullstack programming course. I want to break my outline into lessons and generate a nice HTML view from the markdown files that will become the basis for an interactive textbook. [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/){:target="_blank"} is the tool, documentation can be found [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/introduction.html){:target="_blank"}. Here is how I set it up and got started.

# Installing R with VS Code

Bookdown using the R programming langauge and markdown documents. So the first step is getting R running with the necessary packages. And I want it integrated in VSCode.

 1. Install R: [https://cloud.r-project.org/](https://cloud.r-project.org/) (make sure to check "Save version number in registry")
 2. Install VSCode R editor support: [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=REditorSupport.r](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=REditorSupport.r)
 3. In R install `languageserver`: [https://github.com/REditorSupport/languageserver](https://github.com/REditorSupport/languageserver)
     - open RGui on Windows
     - run `install.packages("languageserver")`
     - also install `rmarkdown` with: `install.packages("rmarkdown")`
 4. Make sure R is on the system PATH, for me that was `C:\Program Files\R\R-4.2.2\bin`
 5. Close and re-open VS Code if you cannot access R interactive shell from the command-line. There should also be a new terminal option "R Terminal" that opens an interactive shell.
     - can double check the packages installed with `install.packages("languageserver")` at the R Terminal, this shouldn't do anything.

Once that was setup, I made a test R script `test.R`:

```r
# My first program in R Programming
myString <- "Hello, World!"

print (myString)
```

And ran `R test.R` at the terminal. It worked. So R is up and running!

# First Steps with Bookdown

To install bookdown for R, I just need to run (at the R terminal):

```r
install.packages("bookdown")
```

## Minimal Example

Bookdown is built on [`rmarkdown`](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html){:target="_blank"}. A demo for staring a project can be found [here](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown-demo){:target="_blank"}. However, I used the [documentation](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/get-started.html){:target="_blank"} minimal example [here](https://github.com/yihui/bookdown-minimal){:target="_blank"}.

### `render_book()`

I downloaded `index.Rmd`, then in the R terminal I ran: 

```r
bookdown::render_book('index.Rmd', 'all')
```

This generated a folder `_book/` with a static HTML version of the content. This is the built book, and all arguments can be found in the [documentation](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/build-the-book.html){:target="_blank"}:

```r
bookdown::render_book(input = ".", output_format = NULL, ..., clean = TRUE,
  envir = parent.frame(), clean_envir = !interactive(),
  output_dir = NULL, new_session = NA, preview = FALSE,
  config_file = "_bookdown.yml")
```

By leaving `output_format` empty, the book is rendered as the first output format specified in the YAML metadata of the first `.Rmd` file or a separate YAML file `_output.yml` (see [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/output-formats.html){:target="_blank"}). When you set `preview = TRUE`, only the Rmd files specified in the `input` argument are rendered, which can be convenient when previewing a certain chapter, since you do not recompile the whole book, but when publishing a book, this argument should certainly be set to `FALSE`.

### `clean_book()`

You can delete the built book with:

```r
bookdown::clean_book(TRUE)
```

But be careful that things are version controlled with git so you don't lose anything.

### Viewing the Book

To view the static site in the `_book/` directory. I installed the VSCode extension [Live Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server){:target="_blank"}. All I need to do is select one of the `.html` files, click the preview button in the code editor, and there it is. I can also just navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:3000/_book/` in my browser. It even updates as I add chapters and redo the `render_book()` command.

If the book is getting long and the pandoc conversion step of `render_book()` is taking awhile, then an individual chapter can be re-rendered using:

```r
bookdown::preview_chapter("index.md")
```

## Practical Example

### Chapter Order

My default, bookdown will render files in the order of their name (e.g., `01-something.Rmd`, `02-something-else.Rmd`, etc.). I don't want to provide an order in filenames, because I may want to remix and rematch. So I just need to override this behavior by making a `_bookdown.yml` file in the book directory and providing a file list:

```yaml
rmd_files: ["02.Rmd", "01.Rmd", "index.Rmd"]
```

Filenames that start with an `_` underscore are skipped. The file `index.Rmd` will *always* be treated as the first even if re-ordered in the list.

I can create an appendix with `# (APPENDIX) Appendix {-}` at the top of a file, the `{-}` characters tell markdown not to give this a section number

### Front Matter

For now, I want the book to render as a [gitbook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/html.html#gitbook-style){:target="_blank"}, which provides nice links and a navigation pane. So the front-matter of the index file should look like so:

```r
# index.Rmd

---
title: "A Book"
author: "Ben"
site: bookdown::bookdown_site 
documentclass: book
output:
  bookdown::gitbook: default
  #bookdown::pdf_book: default
---
```

The `site: bookdown::bookdown_site` pair calls `bookdown::render_book()`, and the output is specified as `bookdown::gitbook`. The outputs can also be specified in a separate `_output.yml` document as shown [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/output-formats.html){:target="_blank"}, which is maybe better from an organizational standpoint. So now if I just run:

```r
bookdown::render_book()
```

then everything works. Also because I have the `_bookdown.yml` in my root directory, which `render_book()` looks for by default, my chapter order and other variables are set correctly.

### Markdown

But what if I don't care about `.Rmd` files, because I don't plan to have integrated R code? Well, I can just use `.md` markdown files! If I changed all the filenames and replace the `_bookdown.yml` file list with:

```yaml
# _bookdown.yml

rmd_files: ["02.md", "01.md", "index.md"]
```

And when I `bookdown::render_book()` and visit `http://127.0.0.1:3000/_book/`, then everything looks good!

For the `#` heading in each file, if I add `{-}`, then it will skip section numbering.

# Publishing on GitHub

I want to create github repo for the project, and I would also like to view the rendered site as updates are made. There are instructions [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/github.html){:target="_blank"}.
